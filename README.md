# Guessing Game Project

-  Create a game that runs in the browser
- This game will be able to be reset by either refreshing the page or clicking a "reset" button.
- The game objective is to "guess" the correct number.
- The number will be randomly generated by the game.
- Input will happen through a form
- The game will keep track of the number of guesses the user makes
- If the guess is correct the game will finish and a success message will display on the screen
- If the user fails to guess after 3 attempts the game will finish and a failure message will display on the screen

## Requirements

- The failure message will be in the form of an Error so we can practice error handling
- No need for fancy styling but later on it might be nice to make it look good
- Using plain html and JavaScript
